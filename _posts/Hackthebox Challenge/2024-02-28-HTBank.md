# HTBank - EASY

## Description

<Sup>Author: @DRAL3N & @Xclow3n</sup><br>
A notorious bank has recently opened its doors, claiming to house the wealth of the entire world. Can you reclaim what is rightfully yours? Here's a wizard's tip: the bank only permits withdrawals of 1337 units of currency at a time. Are you up for the challenge?

## Solution

**After start machine I see a website with a searching page.**

![img-login](/assets/img/2024-02-28-HTBank/website-login.png)

After register and login into the website, I see this website allowed me to withdraw money. But feature add money is not working.

So let's see the vuln of the website.

### Vulnerability

```python
@api.route('/withdraw', methods=['POST'])
@isAuthenticated
def withdraw(decoded_token):
    body = request.get_data()
    amount = request.form.get('amount', '')
    account = request.form.get('account', '')

    if not amount or not account:
        return response('All fields are required!'), 401

    user = getUser(decoded_token.get('username'))

    try:
        if (int(user[0].get('balance')) < int(amount) or int(amount) < 0 ):
            return response('Not enough credits!'), 400

        res = requests.post(f"http://{current_app.config.get('PHP_HOST')}/api/withdraw",
            headers={"content-type": request.headers.get("content-type")}, data=body)

        jsonRes = res.json()

        return response(jsonRes['message'])
    except:
        return response('Only accept number!'), 500
```

That is only one endpoint that I can access.
After review this code, I see the `body` is not sanitized.
and send it into php backend.

That mean I can use `HPP` to attack this website. because first parameter will be on python frontend and second parameter will be on php backend.
